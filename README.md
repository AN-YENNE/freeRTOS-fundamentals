# FreeRTOS Task Examples for STM32

This repository contains a series of practical **FreeRTOS task management examples** designed for STM32 microcontrollers. Each example demonstrates core FreeRTOS concepts such as task creation, parameter passing, priority management, suspension, resumption, deletion, and more.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- STM32 microcontroller development board (e.g., STM32F4 series)
- STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE (or equivalent toolchain)
- FreeRTOS library integrated in your project
- UART configured for debugging output (usually USART2)
- Basic familiarity with embedded C and FreeRTOS API

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freertos-task-examples.git
````

2. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE or your preferred IDE.

3. Build and flash the example onto your STM32 board.

4. Open a serial terminal at the configured baud rate to observe UART outputs.

5. Experiment by modifying thresholds, priorities, and task parameters.
