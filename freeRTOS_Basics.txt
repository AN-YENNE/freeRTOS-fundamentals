What is an RTOS?
A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is a specialized OS that enables deterministic task scheduling with guaranteed response times. Unlike general-purpose OSs, it focuses on predictability and timing constraints, critical for embedded applications such as motor control, data acquisition, or communication systems.
Key Characteristics:
•
Multitasking with preemptive or cooperative scheduling.
•
Real-time constraints (e.g., deadlines).
•
Minimal latency.
•
Support for inter-task communication and resource synchronization.
